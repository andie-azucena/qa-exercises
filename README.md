# QA Challenges

This repository contains several QA exercises to be used for training.

These exercises were taken from other git repositories:
* https://github.com/coveo/QA-challenge (automation)
* https://github.com/LiveIntent/qa-challenge (automation)
* https://github.com/zizooboats/qa-challenge (manual)
* https://github.com/ExponentialTech/qa-challenges (manual)
* https://github.com/codacy/qa-frontend-challenge (manual)
* https://gitlab.com/trufla/qa-challenge (automation)

Credit goes to the original authors of these exercises. I don't own these and only have them in a single repository for convenience.
